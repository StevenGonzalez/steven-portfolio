# On Engineering Tradeoffs

In practice, most systems are defined by the tradeoffs they choose.

- Favor clarity over cleverness.
- Prefer boring, reliable tech for critical paths.
- Make failure modes explicit.

When tradeoffs are intentional and documented, teams move faster and incidents become learning opportunities instead of surprises.
